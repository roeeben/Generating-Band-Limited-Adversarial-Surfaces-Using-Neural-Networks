First steps toward recreating the paper
"Generating Adversarial Surfaces via Band-Limited Perturbations"
for kickoff presentation:

1. Train a PointNet classifier (afterwards use a better classifier for 3d meshes/point 		clouds)
2. Create a Targeted attack on a point cloud, Check (Visualize) if the results are 			similar to what we've seen in the paper
3. Create an Untargeted attack on a point cloud, Check the results in the same manner

Next steps:
* Thinking about our actual contribution to this...
