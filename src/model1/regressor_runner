# This is the main script that runs out model1:

# Using the central article's method in the neural setting
# '(revolves around regressing for the optimal smooth deformation field parameters needed to optimally deform the target'
# ' shape to achieve target/untargeted adverserial attack success)
# Architecture: Simple PointNet (Without T-Nets, see implementation in the Shape Completion Repo)
# + switch last layer to regression layer
